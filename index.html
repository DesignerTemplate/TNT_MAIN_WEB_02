    🎯 Classical vs. BROSUMSI Definitions of Surplus

    Consumer Surplus (CS)

    Classical definition:
    Consumer surplus is the difference between the maximum price a buyer is willing to pay for a good and the actual price paid. It's meant to reflect the buyer’s net gain from the transaction.

        P_max(x): the buyer’s subjective maximum price

        P(x): the actual market price

    Classical surplus is written as:
    CS(x) = P_max(x) − P(x)

    But this is usually expressed over ℝ, even though the buyer is making an integer-valued, bounded, discrete decision.

    BROSUMSI definition:
    In BROSUMSI, prices are integers. So is surplus. All values are subjective, local, and recorded at the moment of choice. There’s no continuous optimization—only integer deltas under constraint.

    Let:

        P_max(x): the buyer’s subjective value of the good (in cents)

        P(x): the actual price paid (in cents)

    Then:

    CS(x) = P_max(x) − P(x)
    CS(x) ∈ ℤ

    Interpretation:

        If CS(x) > 0: the buyer perceives the good as worth more than it cost → the trade happens.

        If CS(x) < 0: the good costs more than it’s worth to the buyer → no trade.

    This is not theoretical—it’s a ledger delta. It gets recorded. It reflects a belief, not an optimization.

    Producer Surplus (PS)

    Classical definition:
    Producer surplus is the difference between the price received and the seller’s minimum acceptable price. It’s a measure of subjective gain from the transaction.

        P(x): the actual price received

        P_min(x): the seller’s internal cutoff

    Classical surplus:
    PS(x) = P(x) − P_min(x)

    But again, it's defined over ℝ—detached from how sellers actually make decisions.

    BROSUMSI definition:
    Same structure, now grounded in integer reality.

    Let:

        P_min(x): the seller’s internal minimum price—accounting for cost, risk, effort, and opportunity

        P(x): the price actually received

    Then:

    PS(x) = P(x) − P_min(x)
    PS(x) ∈ ℤ

    Interpretation:

        If PS(x) > 0: seller gets more than their subjective cost → the trade proceeds.

        If PS(x) < 0: the deal isn’t worth it → no trade.

    For bounded agents, P_min(x) isn’t just a number—it encodes fatigue, risk tolerance, time cost, and motivation. In practice, it acts like a reservation wage.

    Key Point:
    Both CS and PS in BROSUMSI are per-event, integer-valued, and epistemically grounded. They aren’t curves or integrals—they’re agent-relative truth claims, resolved at the point of decision, recorded in the ledger.

    They’re not hypothetical benefits. They’re logged, structured, and mechanically conserved.

    Surplus as Subjective Utility

    In the BROSUMSI framework, consumer and producer surplus are not approximated over real-valued curves. They are formalized as discrete, integer-valued changes in perceived welfare—ΔU values recorded per transaction. Surplus is local, agent-relative, epistemically gated, and resolved only after the transaction is complete. There is no global optimization, only subjective expectations grounded in bounded cognition.

    Each surplus is defined ex-ante and resolved ex-post, not as a theoretical construct but as a verifiable ledger state—an entry in the agent’s subjective accounting system. These values have three key characteristics:

        Agent-relative: Surplus is not defined globally. Each agent sets their internal valuation—maximum willingness to pay (P_max) or minimum acceptable compensation (P_min)—based on their subjective epistemic frame at the moment of decision.

        Integer-valued: All prices, costs, and utility differences are measured in discrete monetary units (e.g., cents). Surplus is formally defined over ℤ, not ℝ.

        Cognitively bounded: Agents operate under limited foresight, incomplete information, and finite processing capacity. Their valuations are heuristic, not exhaustive.

    From this, a transaction occurs if and only if it is voluntary—that is, if both agents subjectively expect to benefit:

    A trade proceeds if and only if CS(x) > 0 and PS(x) > 0.

    This preserves the classical notion of mutual benefit, but reinterprets it under epistemic realism. Surplus is no longer derived from a cardinal utility function—it is a local, subjective delta encoded in the agent’s internal ledger.

    Transaction Structure and Formalization

    Each transaction is constructed as a dual, time-indexed epistemic event. It consists of two agents—a buyer and a seller—and two pairs of utility values: one ex-ante (the agent’s belief before acting) and one ex-post (their realized valuation after the outcome is known).

    This structure is captured in the Coq formal model using the following primitives:

        Agents and goods are indexed over ℕ, supporting first-order reasoning and type-safe lookups.

        Surplus values are structured using du_per_t, which includes:

            du_ex_ante: the expected utility delta (e.g., CS or PS), declared at time t_decision.

            du_ex_post: a function from WorldState to ℤ, representing the resolved utility after time t_resolve.
