        <h1>üéØ Classical vs. BROSUMSI Definitions of Surplus</h1>
        <p>
          <b>Consumer Surplus (CS)</b>
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>Classical definition:</b>
          <br />
          Consumer surplus is the difference between the maximum price a buyer is willing to pay for a good and the actual price paid. It's meant to reflect the buyer‚Äôs net gain from the transaction.
          <br />
          P_max(x): the buyer‚Äôs subjective maximum price
          <br />
          P(x): the actual market price
          <br />
          <br />
          Classical surplus is written as:
          <br />
          CS(x) = P_max(x) ‚àí P(x)
          <br />
          But this is usually expressed over ‚Ñù, even though the buyer is making an integer-valued, bounded, discrete decision.
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>BROSUMSI definition:</b>
          <br />
          In BROSUMSI, prices are integers. So is surplus. All values are subjective, local, and recorded at the moment of choice. There‚Äôs no continuous optimization‚Äîonly integer deltas under constraint.
          <br />
          Let:
          <br />
          P_max(x): the buyer‚Äôs subjective value of the good (in cents)
          <br />
          P(x): the actual price paid (in cents)
          <br />
          Then:
          <br />
          CS(x) = P_max(x) ‚àí P(x)
          <br />
          CS(x) ‚àà ‚Ñ§
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>Interpretation:</b>
          <br />
          If CS(x) > 0: the buyer perceives the good as worth more than it cost ‚Üí the trade happens.
          <br />
          If CS(x) < 0: the good costs more than it‚Äôs worth to the buyer ‚Üí no trade.
          <br />
          This is not theoretical‚Äîit‚Äôs a ledger delta. It gets recorded. It reflects a belief, not an optimization.
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>Producer Surplus (PS)</b>
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>Classical definition:</b>
          <br />
          Producer surplus is the difference between the price received and the seller‚Äôs minimum acceptable price. It‚Äôs a measure of subjective gain from the transaction.
          <br />
          P(x): the actual price received
          <br />
          P_min(x): the seller‚Äôs internal cutoff
          <br />
          <br />
          Classical surplus:
          <br />
          PS(x) = P(x) ‚àí P_min(x)
          <br />
          But again, it's defined over ‚Ñù‚Äîdetached from how sellers actually make decisions.
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>BROSUMSI definition:</b>
          <br />
          Same structure, now grounded in integer reality.
          <br />
          Let:
          <br />
          P_min(x): the seller‚Äôs internal minimum price‚Äîaccounting for cost, risk, effort, and opportunity
          <br />
          P(x): the price actually received
          <br />
          Then:
          <br />
          PS(x) = P(x) ‚àí P_min(x)
          <br />
          PS(x) ‚àà ‚Ñ§
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>Interpretation:</b>
          <br />
          If PS(x) > 0: seller gets more than their subjective cost ‚Üí the trade proceeds.
          <br />
          If PS(x) < 0: the deal isn‚Äôt worth it ‚Üí no trade.
          <br />
          For bounded agents, P_min(x) isn‚Äôt just a number‚Äîit encodes fatigue, risk tolerance, time cost, and motivation. In practice, it acts like a reservation wage.
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>Key Point:</b>
          <br />
          Both CS and PS in BROSUMSI are per-event, integer-valued, and epistemically grounded. They aren‚Äôt curves or integrals‚Äîthey‚Äôre agent-relative truth claims, resolved at the point of decision, recorded in the ledger.
          <br />
          They‚Äôre not hypothetical benefits. They‚Äôre logged, structured, and mechanically conserved.
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>Surplus as Subjective Utility</b>
          <br />
          In the BROSUMSI framework, consumer and producer surplus are not approximated over real-valued curves. They are formalized as discrete, integer-valued changes in perceived welfare‚ÄîŒîU values recorded per transaction. Surplus is local, agent-relative, epistemically gated, and resolved only after the transaction is complete. There is no global optimization, only subjective expectations grounded in bounded cognition.
          <br />
          Each surplus is defined ex-ante and resolved ex-post, not as a theoretical construct but as a verifiable ledger state‚Äîan entry in the agent‚Äôs subjective accounting system. These values have three key characteristics:
          <br />
          <br />
          Agent-relative: Surplus is not defined globally. Each agent sets their internal valuation‚Äîmaximum willingness to pay (P_max) or minimum acceptable compensation (P_min)‚Äîbased on their subjective epistemic frame at the moment of decision.
          <br />
          Integer-valued: All prices, costs, and utility differences are measured in discrete monetary units (e.g., cents). Surplus is formally defined over ‚Ñ§, not ‚Ñù.
          <br />
          Cognitively bounded: Agents operate under limited foresight, incomplete information, and finite processing capacity. Their valuations are heuristic, not exhaustive.
          <br />
          From this, a transaction occurs if and only if it is voluntary‚Äîthat is, if both agents subjectively expect to benefit:
          <br />
          A trade proceeds if and only if CS(x) > 0 and PS(x) > 0.
          <br />
          This preserves the classical notion of mutual benefit, but reinterprets it under epistemic realism. Surplus is no longer derived from a cardinal utility function‚Äîit is a local, subjective delta encoded in the agent‚Äôs internal ledger.
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>Transaction Structure and Formalization</b>
          <br />
          Each transaction is constructed as a dual, time-indexed epistemic event. It consists of two agents‚Äîa buyer and a seller‚Äîand two pairs of utility values: one ex-ante (the agent‚Äôs belief before acting) and one ex-post (their realized valuation after the outcome is known).
          <br />
          This structure is captured in the Coq formal model using the following primitives:
          <br />
          Agents and goods are indexed over ‚Ñï, supporting first-order reasoning and type-safe lookups.
          <br />
          Surplus values are structured using du_per_t, which includes:
          <br />
          du_ex_ante: the expected utility delta (e.g., CS or PS), declared at time t_decision.
          <br />
          du_ex_post: a function from WorldState to ‚Ñ§, representing the resolved utility after time t_resolve.
