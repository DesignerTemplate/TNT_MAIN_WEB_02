    🎯 Classical vs. BROSUMSI Definitions of Surplus

    Consumer Surplus (CS)

    Classical definition:
    Consumer surplus is the difference between the maximum price a buyer is willing to pay for a good and the actual price paid. It's meant to reflect the buyer’s net gain from the transaction.

        P_max(x): the buyer’s subjective maximum price

        P(x): the actual market price

    Classical surplus is written as:
    CS(x) = P_max(x) − P(x)

    But this is usually expressed over ℝ, even though the buyer is making an integer-valued, bounded, discrete decision.

    BROSUMSI definition:
    In BROSUMSI, prices are integers. So is surplus. All values are subjective, local, and recorded at the moment of choice. There’s no continuous optimization—only integer deltas under constraint.

    Let:

        P_max(x): the buyer’s subjective value of the good (in cents)

        P(x): the actual price paid (in cents)

    Then:

    CS(x) = P_max(x) − P(x)
    CS(x) ∈ ℤ

    Interpretation:

        If CS(x) > 0: the buyer perceives the good as worth more than it cost → the trade happens.

        If CS(x) < 0: the good costs more than it’s worth to the buyer → no trade.

    This is not theoretical—it’s a ledger delta. It gets recorded. It reflects a belief, not an optimization.

    Producer Surplus (PS)

    Classical definition:
    Producer surplus is the difference between the price received and the seller’s minimum acceptable price. It’s a measure of subjective gain from the transaction.

        P(x): the actual price received

        P_min(x): the seller’s internal cutoff

    Classical surplus:
    PS(x) = P(x) − P_min(x)

    But again, it's defined over ℝ—detached from how sellers actually make decisions.

    BROSUMSI definition:
    Same structure, now grounded in integer reality.

    Let:

        P_min(x): the seller’s internal minimum price—accounting for cost, risk, effort, and opportunity

        P(x): the price actually received

    Then:

    PS(x) = P(x) − P_min(x)
    PS(x) ∈ ℤ

    Interpretation:

        If PS(x) > 0: seller gets more than their subjective cost → the trade proceeds.

        If PS(x) < 0: the deal isn’t worth it → no trade.

    For bounded agents, P_min(x) isn’t just a number—it encodes fatigue, risk tolerance, time cost, and motivation. In practice, it acts like a reservation wage.

    Key Point:
    Both CS and PS in BROSUMSI are per-event, integer-valued, and epistemically grounded. They aren’t curves or integrals—they’re agent-relative truth claims, resolved at the point of decision, recorded in the ledger.

    They’re not hypothetical benefits. They’re logged, structured, and mechanically conserved.

    Surplus as Subjective Utility

    In the BROSUMSI framework, consumer and producer surplus are not approximated over real-valued curves. They are formalized as discrete, integer-valued changes in perceived welfare—ΔU values recorded per
